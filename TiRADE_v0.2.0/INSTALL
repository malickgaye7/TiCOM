Installation Instructions
*************************

Installation of TiRADE requires the following:

	1. A C compiler. Development has been done on Linux and MacOS using the GNU 
		compiler gcc. 
		
	2. The make utility.  

Once you have obtained and installed the required software, uncompress and 
unarchive the TiRADE distribution you obtained:

	tar -xvzf TiRADE_vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
	
Enter the root directory for the package:

	cd TiRADE_vX.Y.Z
	
To build the package run:

	make tirade.x

If you modify the source code, you will need to run make again to rebuild the
application. It may be helpful to first run:

	make clean
	
to remove the old object files before rebuilding.

Running the software
********************

TiRADE requires an input file containing values of orbital and physical 
properties relevant to your particular problem, flags indicating which output
files you want to produce, the path to a directory into which the output should 
be written, and the following rheological parameters for each 
layer.  

Outer radius (m)	Density (kg/m^3)	shear mod (Pa)	bulk mod (Pa)	Viscosity (Pa s)

starting with the innermost layer, and progressing outward to the surface. 
The first layer MUST be inviscid and strengthless (columns 3 and 5 must be 0). 

Additional information regarding setup of the input file can be found in the
documentation.

Ensure the output directory specified in the input file exists. Run the 
program: 

	tirade.x <input_file>

replacing input_file with the path and name of your actual input file. 
Additionally, if you issue the command outside of the directory containing the 
executable: TiRADE_vX.Y.Z/bin/ you will need to either give the full path to 
the executable, add TiRADE_vX.Y.Z/bin/ to your path, or define an alias.
