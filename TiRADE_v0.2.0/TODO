Tidal Response And Dissipation of Energy (TiRADE)

This is a list of planned modifications and upgrades to TiRADE. They are listed 
roughly in order of priority, but no timetable is attached to them. Feel free
to make suggestions, but I make no promises about implementing them. To quote 
my son's preschool teacher, "You get what you get, and you don't get upset!"

	- Rewrite Legendre Polynomial and Gauss Jordan functions
	
	- Handle fluid layers properly. This will require a modification to the 
		propagator matrices at the fluid-solid interface. Fluids do not 
		support shear stresses, and so the y4 radial function is identically
		zero in these layers.
		
	- Relax the assumption of a fluid innermost core. Need to figure out how to
		fix the inner boundary conditions for that one.
		
	- Include rheologies beyond Maxwell (e.g., Andrade)
	
	- Include obliquity tides (important for Triton)
	
	- Include dissipation in fluid layers (you don't get this in a viscoelastic
		formulation)
	
	- Decouple grid spacing from the number of layers.
	
	- Implement freeze-thaw in thermodynamically consistent way.
