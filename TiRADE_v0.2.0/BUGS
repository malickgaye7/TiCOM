BUGS

Tidal Response And Dissipation of Energy (TiRADE)

List of Known Bugs
===============================================================================
	- If fluid layer (e.g., ocean) is very close to the surface, accuracy of
		calculation in outer shell is degraded. 
	
	- Accuracy may be degraded in the Maxwell time of the "fluid" layer is 
		similar to the forcing period.  
		
	- The "bottom" heating (e.g. at the CMB or base of the ice shell) is 
		really the heating at the 11th layer. If there are not exactly 10
		layers below the CMB, this will not really be the heating at the
		basal layer. 
		
To report a bug
===============================================================================
	Send an email to James.Roberts@jhuapl.edu with a description of the
	unexpected behavior. It will be helpful if you attach your input file so I
	can attempt to reproduce the error. 
	
	Not all reported bugs may actually turn out to be bugs. Often it turns out
	to be perfectly reasonable but non-intuitive behavior. It never hurts to 
	report a bug, but first it's worth just checking that the behavior you 
	observe really doesn't make sense.
