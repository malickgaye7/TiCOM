Tidal Response And Dissipation of Energy (TiRADE)

TiRADE is an application for computing the viscoelastic response of a 
a synchronously rotating, multilayered body to tidal forces, and for computing
the tidally-dissipated energy. It optionally contains a module for modeling 
thermal conduction within the body and computing the time evolution of the 
temperature and viscosity profiles. 

TiRADE is written in C, a mid-level programming language that is highly 
portable. With some modification, the modules should be easy to integrate 
into existing C codes.

TiRADE was written by James Roberts (James.H.Roberts@jhuapl.edu). while at the 
University of California, Santa Cruz. It is freely available for use in non-profit research, but cannot be 
incorporated into commercial packages. See the COPYING file for more information
